I am writing to formally request access to the Ronin Archive Node for our project, Axie Brazil. We are a dashboard developed for the Brazilian Axie Infinity player community. Our platform provides an intuitive interface that allows users to filter and analyze data about their Axies, offering valuable insights to optimize their gameplay strategies.
